# About the Project

This project was built as part of a hackathon to demonstrate the design and development of a robust E-commerce Backend System. We focused on implementing all essential functionalities required for an online shopping platform.

We also created a basic frontend demonstration to showcase how the backend connects and works with user interfaces for actions like login, register, cart operations, and placing orders.
